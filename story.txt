One day a duck named Dalilah met a duck names Chad. 

Chad wore a hat and liked to drink beer. Dalilah liked sprite and singing. 

They went to a big pond Dalilah started singing.

Another duck named Casey appeared and yelled "Stop squeaking!!"
And Chad said 

"Go eat a mango you strange duck"
And Casey was very sad, because Casey did not like mangoes.
Dalilah felt sad for Casey so she gave Casey an apple.
